            <h2>Research in Oshikawa Group</h2>
            <p>Main interest of mine may be:</p>
            <blockquote style="margin: 1.5rem 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
                How can we understand a strongly interacting system with large number of degrees of freedom?
            </blockquote>
            <p>This is actually the main theme of the statistical physics and perhaps of the condensed matter physics. Field theory, although it might appear as a totally different subject, also turns out to be very closely related to this question.</p>
            <p>I don't like to separate a particular subfield of physics (or even physics from other branches of science.) I strongly believe that the important value of physics lies at the notion of universality among many apparently unrelated phenomena.</p>
            <p>However, my actual research has been naturally limited to some particular topics. (not that I am not interested in other problems.) Mostly I have been working on quantum many-body problems, such as quantum spin systems and low-dimensional electron systems.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I work on something rather abstract, which has no direct relevance to experiments. I do not think theoretical physics is just fitting (or predicting) experimental data. On the other hand, physics is certainly an attempt to understand <em>real world.</em> Nature is indeed deep and is often beyond imagination of mankind. And it's fun to play with experimental data and to talk with experimentalists.</p>
            <p>Members (students, postdocs) of my group are free to pursue their own interests, although discussion within (and outside) the group is strongly encouraged.</p>
