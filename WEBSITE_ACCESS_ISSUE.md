# Website Access Issue

## Problem
I have been tasked with faithfully reproducing the content from the original website:
https://oshikawa.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html

## Current Situation
Unfortunately, I cannot access the original website due to DNS resolution failure. The domain `oshikawa.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp` is not accessible from my environment.

### Attempts Made:
1. Direct browser navigation - blocked by network policy
2. curl command - DNS resolution failed
3. wget command - DNS resolution failed
4. Wayback Machine search - no results
5. Repository search for backup content - no findings

## Resolution Needed
To complete this task, I need one of the following:

### Option 1: Provide Website Content
If you can access the website, please provide:
- The HTML source code of the original pages
- Or a text description of all content sections
- Or screenshots of all pages

### Option 2: Alternative Access
- A different URL that works
- VPN or proxy instructions if needed
- Exported content files

### Option 3: Content Specification
If you can specify exactly what information needs to be included:
- Research topics
- Publications list
- Member names and roles
- Contact details
- Any other specific content

## Current Repository Status
The repository already has:
- index.html (with placeholder content)
- research.html (with general research topics)
- publications.html (with sample publications)
- members.html (with placeholder member information)
- contact.html (with contact information)

These files have generic/placeholder content that should be replaced with the actual content from the original website.
